    <h1>SPREADING OF CORONAVIRUSES</h1>   
    <p>As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. </p>

        <br>-Wear a mask in public, especially indoors or when physical distancing is not possible.
        <br>-Choose open, well-ventilated spaces over closed ones. Open a window if indoors.
        <br>-Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an alcohol-based hand rub.
